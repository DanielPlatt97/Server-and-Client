*This was originally for a University assignment, but I have extended 
the programs from the original requirements considerably*

Two programs:

Client - Connects to the messaging server to send and recieve messages
to other clients

Server - Hosts the messaging server, the admin hosting the server
can also speak to the clients using the server program.

Both clients and the server admin can use different commands by 
typing /[command].
